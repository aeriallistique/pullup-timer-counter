# Pull up timer

Pull up timer I put together to help with my attempt to beat the `Guinness Wolrd Record for Most Pull ups in 24 Hours`.

I innitially designed the app for the background color to change every 30 seconds but that did not look good on camera for the official attempt so I commented it out.
It plays a "ding" every 30 seconds as a loud reminder to get on the bar.

The `howMuchTimeLeft` function is there to help pace me to the end of the 24 hours.
it informs me of the time left, how many more pull-ups I need to get to 10k and how many I need to perform every 30 seconds in order to make it.
